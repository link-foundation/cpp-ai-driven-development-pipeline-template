# Check release credentials and distinguish proven access from unknown scope.
#
# Principle 16 of the shared CI/CD best practices ("Prove You Can Publish
# Before You Build"; adapted from
# link-foundation/python-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template, issues #74
# and #77 there). A non-empty secret proves nothing (an expired token is
# non-empty), and a login proves authentication, not authorisation. Each probe
# therefore attempts a write that cannot succeed:
#   - GitHub (always): create a ref pointing at an object that does not
#     exist. 422 means the token passed the contents:write check and only the
#     payload was refused; 403/404 means the release commit, tag and GitHub
#     release would be refused. Nothing is created.
#   - NuGet (NUGET_PUBLISH=true): obtain a verification key, then verify it
#     against an existing package version. Only the second request checks
#     the package id/glob and owner. With NUGET_USER set, trusted publishing
#     takes priority; its OIDC exchange is deferred to the release job and
#     reported as unknown here. Neither path publishes during preflight.
#   - Conan remote (CONAN_REMOTE_URL set): Conan's server API has no dry-run
#     upload, so a successful login is reported as `unknown` -- never as a
#     pass -- and a refused login as a failure.
#
# PREFLIGHT_MODE:
#   release -- push to main / manual instant release. A refused credential
#              fails the run here, before the publishing job spends a minute.
#   report  -- pull requests, where a fork legitimately has no publishing
#              secrets. The same probes run and annotate, but never block.
#
# Rules each caller depends on (each is a defect if dropped):
#   1. Report every failure, not the first -- no probe aborts the script.
#   2. Report `unknown`, never a guess: a timeout or a 429 has not said the
#      credential is broken. But a release-mode run that verified nothing is
#      not a pass.
#   3. Probe with a write, not a login.
#
# No set -e on purpose: rule 1 means one failed probe must not hide the rest.
